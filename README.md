# TSPeach Teach yourself to Pronounce 

Communication is everything! For non-native or physically impared english speakers, it can be difficulty and even embarrasing not being able to pronounce certain words. Using Assembly AI we aim to solve this!


### Getting Started
We tried to figure out what kept us connected during the pandemic other then the non ending zoom meetings or the occasional time you spend in class together, and fundamentally this all came down to our ability to just speak and once we started thinking about it we couldn't stop

### Prerequisites

All the libraries used are in requirements.txt, and everything is linked in the index.html file. Installing according to the following section will automatically install dependencies.

Example
```
 <script src="assets/js/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
```


### Installing

Being based in Node.JS, first clone this repository, then enter its folder directory.

Then run (making sure that nodejs is installed)
```
npm install
```
After all dependencies are installed, start the server and client components of the application with the following commands.
```

npm run server

```
```

npm run client

```
You should now be able to use the web-app through any browser (Including Mobile) at localhost:3000


## Feedback

We used assemblyai to get real time transcript of the user input and mark the words that are pronounced inaccurately allowing the user to get instant feedback on their performance.

### Results

The user input is read and if the pronounication is detected to be wrong the algorithm marks these words for the user to study them in the future and perform better in the future.

### Conclusion

To conclude, our project works as expected and we hope it allows individuals to gain confidence in their speaking skills to stay conencted in a time like this.
